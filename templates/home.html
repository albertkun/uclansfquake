              <p class="text-justify">Tall buildings have become a staple of central business districts in the United States and other parts of the world, reflecting the intersection of increased urbanization with the constraints of limited land space. Their physical size and the concentration of people and services is such that any disruption to their functionality in the wake of an extreme event such as a major earthquake can be detrimental to the economic vitality of the urban centers that they occupy. This provides an added incentive to ensure that tall buildings are resilient to natural and man-made hazards, particularly when they are in locations of dense spatial clustering. This websites is dedicated to showcasing the ongoing activities of a project funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) on <i>Utilizing Remote Sensing to Assess the Implication of Tall Building Performance on the Resilience of Urban Centers.</i></p>
              <p class="text-justify">The overall goal of the project is to develop a testbed framework that systematically demonstrates how remote sensing can be used to assess and improve the seismic resilience of tall buildings in dense urban environments. The specific objectives include (1) a systematic data collection effort on California buildings that have seismic instrumentation as well as measured structural responses from past earthquakes, (2) creating advanced statistical and machine learning methods for extrapolating measured response quantities and damage assessments for both instrumented and non-instrumented buildings, (3) conducting multi-limit state (functional loss, building closure, demolition and collapse) assessments to probabilistically quantify the level of disruption caused by tall buildings immediately following a major earthquake, (4) developing methods to rapidly assess the functional and safety state of an earthquake-impacted tall buildings based on measured responses and/or observed damage and (5) establishing procedures to support optimal decision-making (e.g. if and when to reoccupy the building) in the post-earthquake environment.

              <p class="text-justify">In addition to giving an overview of the ongoing project activities, various types of resources are provided for students, practitioners and researchers including (a) publications, key results from the various sub-tasks, datasets, structural models and code.
